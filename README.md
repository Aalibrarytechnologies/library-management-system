# ðŸ“š A&A Library Technologies â€“ LibraCheck

**LibraCheck** is a modern web-based check-in/out system for public libraries, developed by A&A Library Technologies â€” a company founded to honor two daughters, Alice and Anastasia, and to support community growth through innovation, not automation.

This system is designed to streamline item circulation without eliminating valuable library staff. It runs beautifully on tablets and desktop PCs, making it easy for patrons and staff to use in real-time.
